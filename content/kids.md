***Sierra Nevada and Costa Tropical***
**Skiing and beach in one day? Yes, it&#39;s possible**

Visit the Costa Tropical in Spanish Andalusia, 90 km from Malaga and the Sierra Nevada
mountains to the southernmost ski resort in Europe.
You live by the sea and get to your skis by hired car or organised transfer. The Costa Tropical has a
subtropical climate. The Sierra Nevada resort has more than 100km of pistes.

Who is this offer for?
This is not the best option for people who like to live by the slopes and devote all their time to
skiing. Being passionate about the sport, they do not want to waste their time on anything else.
This is for skiers who also like to ski from bar to bar, enjoying the views while warming up in the
sun. Enjoying the seaside in an exceptionally beautiful place, getting to know something new, going
for tapas in town in the evening, or sitting with wine on the terrace.

Resort
Large, modern ski resort, over 130 km of pistes. Very interesting location, only a few dozen km
from the Mediterranean coast, you can see the sea and the African coast. The most southerly ski
resort, probably in the whole of Europe. The Sierra Nevada mountains are three-thousand-metre
peaks.
Alpine climate, but with a Spanish flavour. Very good infrastructure. A 6-day pass costs around
€250, equipment hire around €90 per week. Prices on the slopes and in the resorts, similar to the
Alps.
Start of season: 30 November, end - most likely the last days of April.

Costa Tropical. Salobreña
This is an option in which we live by the sea and commute (95 km, 1h.15 min)) to the ski resort. We
offer accommodation on the warmest coast of Spain with a subtropical climate. The temperature in
winter is around 20 degrees and it is sunny. In winter it is the season for local tropical fruits.
If you can&#39;t decide whether to go to the Alps or somewhere warm in winter, here you have a 2-in-
one.
