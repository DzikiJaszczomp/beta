Welcome to visit our website. 
This is only a modest beginning, but the site is growing day by day.
Welcome to a wonderful place - the Costa Tropical. Why is it like this? We will try to show you. Itâ€™s worth
being here at any time of year, every season has something special to offer.

I hope our website will encourage you to visit the Costa Tropical. We would like to provide you with as
much practical information as possible, show you interesting places and inspire you to wander.
On our website you will already find information on the best way to travel on the Costa Tropical, even
with a pet, and the necessary contacts.

We encourage you to go hiking, offer route descriptions and ready-made, free guides to download straight
from the website.

We also offer day trips from the Costa Tropical.
Get a taste of what the Costa Tropical tastes like. A section on local flavours is currently being created on
our website. Welcome to the land of tropical fruit, wine, rum, seafood and other flavours.
