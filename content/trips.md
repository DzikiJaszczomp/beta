Guadix, the Granada Geopark

60 km from Granada, 140 km from Salobreńa and Motril
Guadix, a small Andalusian town (around 25,000 inhabitants) is a well-known tourist destination. Tourists
are attracted by the charm of the historic town, but the town's best-known attraction is the inhabited
district of houses carved into the rocks. The city lies at the foot of the Granada Geopark, famous for its
unique nature and extraordinary views. The Sierra Nevada mountains, a short distance from the city, also
provide a beautiful panorama.

Guadix panorama

Guadix is one of the oldest human settlements in Spain. It was an important Roman colony, called Julia
Gemella Acci, and one of the first Christian dioceses in Spain.
Under Muslim rule, the city acquired the Arab urban layout, which still prevails in some streets. In the
11th and 12th centuries, Wadi Acci became together with Baza, one of the most flourishing taifas (small
kingdoms) in Al-Andalus, which disappeared due to the fundamentalist Almohad movement.
The famous writer Pedro Antonio de Alarcon was born in Guadix in 1833. Two of his works were related
to this town: El Niño de la Bola and El Sombrero de Tres Picos. There is a statue of Pedro in the main
square. The Palacio de Marqueses de Peñaflor has a room dedicated to the writer.

Barrio de Cuevas
The local Guadix environment has left its mark on the way of life of the local population, forcing them to
construct a peculiar type of family and communal dwelling: caves.The exact date when the caves began to
be used as a living space is unknown, but it is presumed to be some time after the Islamic period.
Construction was in full swing by the first half of the 16th century.
At the present there are around 2000 caves, inhabited by some 3000 people, the largest cave complex in
Europe.

The Granada Geopark

ZDJĘCIE: GeoIE

The Granada Geopark, declared a World Geopark by UNESCO in 2020, has 4,722 km2 of 47
municipalities belonging to the regions of Guadix, Baza, Huéscar and Montes, it extends over an
exceptional territory in the central sector of the Betic Cordillera surrounded by some of the highest
mountains in the Iberian Peninsula, such as the Sierra de la Sagra or Sierra Nevada.
Here we find most unique landscapes: a semi-desert featuring a succession of tens of thousands of gullies
and badlands surrounded by mountains and the peaks of the Sierra Nevada. The Granada Geopark is one
of the few natural deserts in Europe.

ZDJĘCIE: geopagory

After tens of millions of years spent forming part of ancient seas, the land emerged and was transformed
into a huge enclosed depression surrounded by mountains. A dense network of streams and wadis
collected the rainwater, which, with no outlet to the sea, accumulated in a lake that was located towards
the area of Baza. This process continued for hundreds of thousands of years and the great depression
slowly filled in with sediments in the form of layers of sand, silt and clay, and gypsum.
