GRANADA

full-day excursion every Thursday
small groups of up to 4 or 6 people.
Cost: €45 per person
Those interested in buying tickets to the Alhambra should do so well in advance. It is best to contact me
about this, I will help with the purchase. The ticket costs 19,5EUR.
We leave from Nerja around 8.30 a.m. The journey to Granada takes about 1 hour 20 minutes.
We drive directly to the Alhambra, where we leave the car. The further scenario depends on whether
participants have tickets to the Alhambra and for which hour.
Let's assume that we start with the Alhambra. The tour of the entire complex with tickets takes about 2.5
hours. Those without tickets are taken on a walking tour of the Alhambra, the public areas and the nearby
Martyrs' Garden.
From the Alhambra we head to the Albaicin. This is the most picturesque district of Granada, the former
Arab quarter. It is a district of white houses, winding streets, city squares and plazas. We admire the
magnificent views of the Alhambra and the Sierra Nevada mountains and the city. We look into
Sacromonte, a gypsy quarter of cave houses.
From the Albaicin we walk to the city centre. Here we take a short walk. Later there is free time, to visit
the cathedral, the Royal Chapel, walk around the city, have lunch, tapas, shop. Free time is about 2 hours.
On the way back, we already set off from the centre. This is where the car will be waiting. We plan to
arrive in Nerja around 6 o'clock in the afternoon.
We prefer to explore on foot. We follow my own tried and tested routes, Due to the differences in
elevation in Granada it can be quite difficult for some people. In this case we use minibuses.
Payment: in cash, at the end of the tour

ALPUJARRA and SIERRA NEVADA
Full-day excursion on Fridays
cost EUR 45 per person. Payment in cash at the end of the tour

The last car park is at 2250 metres above sea level. From there we have about a 45-minute walk along an
easy road to the viewpoint. From here you have a fantastic view of the Sierra Lugar and the coast on one
side and the Sierra Nevada on the other. We have the summit of Mulhacen almost at our fingertips.
Everything changes in the mountains: the nature, the air, the view of the world. A great place, great
mountains. And at the foot of the highest peaks, the magnificent Alpujarra.
The Alpujarra are extraordinary historical, cultural, and natural region.
The Alpujarra are picturesque white hilltop towns in the high mountains. During the tour we stop at the
most famous Capileira. Here we have time to walk around, have lunch, sample regional delicacies and
shop.

RONDA
Departures on Wednesdays
Full-day excursion. Departure around 8am, return around 6pm.
Cost EUR 50 per person, payable in cash at the end of the tour.
Additional entrance fees in Ronda (for those who wish).
The town, located on both sides of the Tajo del Ronda, a gorge more than 100 metres deep, is one of the
pearls of Andalusia. It could be said to be the largest pueblo blanco, the white city in Andalusia. Ronda is
famous for its extraordinary views, precious monuments and historical tradition.
The beauty of Ronda has been appreciated by artists and writers (such as Victor Hugo, Orson Welles and
Ernest Hemingway) for centuries. The history of the city remembers the times of the Iberians, Celts,
Greeks, Carthaginians, Arabs and Berbers. Each of these civilisations played an important role in Ronda's
history, and the effects of this can still be seen today in neighbourhoods such as:
The Arab quarter of La Ciudad, the Christian quarter of El Mercadillo, the district of San Francisco
The journey from Nerja to Ronda takes nearly two hours, and from Almunecar 20 minutes longer. The
road itself, the views and the desert landscape are very impressive.
In Ronda we leave the car and go for a walk through the town. It takes about three hours in both
directions. However, it is up to the participants to decide how long they want to walk, where to stop for
longer or shorter periods.
The old town of Ronda has preserved its medieval urban layout and numerous monuments from Roman,
Arab and later times, We are sure to see among others:

Mondragón Palace was built in 1314 for an Arab ruler. After the Reconquest, it was transformed into a
Renaissance residence with mudéjar-style elements.
The Plaza de Toros in Ronda is probably the most famous bullfighting arena in Andalusia and one of the
oldest in the whole of Spain.
Iglesia de Santa María La Mayor Church - a church built on the ruins of a 14th century mosque and
former Roman temple.
El Tajo de Ronda ravine. Stretching over it, the 18th-century Puente Nuevo bridge is one of Ronda's most
important sights. It measures almost 100 metres high, and under its central span is a room that was used as
a prison in the past.
The Baños árabes (Arab baths) in Ronda are one of the best-preserved monuments of their kind in the
Iberian Peninsula. They were built between the 13th and 14th centuries.
In the centre, we will provide 2 hours of free time for lunch, shopping, walking, what ever.

TANGER - Morocco
1 day on Tuesdays
Passport required
Depart from Nerja, Almunecar and surroundings around 7am. Return around 9 in the evening.

We reach Algeciras by car, from where we take a 1.5 hour ferry to Tangier. In Tangier we have a two-hour
guided tour and time to ourselves to immerse ourselves in the city, get a feel for it, have lunch, do some
shopping.
The tour is not advisable for those who are very unwell with seasickness.
The journey through the Strait of Gibraltar alone is extremely impressive. Tangier itself is also a unique
place. Fascinating Tangier has been a favourite travel destination for many famous artists and writers of
the last century. It is therefore worth taking a few days to discover this historic Moroccan city and see for
yourself what inspired artists such as Jack Kerouac and Henri Matisse.
Due to its location almost at the crossroads of continents, Tangier has always been a cultural melting pot.
For a time it was a semi-independent international zone, attracting foreign artists, spies and businessmen.
Cost for a group of up to four people - €350 for the whole group plus about €60 per person - ferry trip.
